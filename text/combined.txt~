The color of this special season excites my heart.
From the first time we met,
The melody of my heart has shouted a sign.
I can’t stop, I won’t stop, Why?
Reach!

It’s vexing but it’s a pure-hearted devotion called love.
Even amidst a slight fever I can’t hesitate.
Accepting the courage to dive in, I’ll soon Start!!
Without a sound, Without an indication,
Fate changes silently.
My heartbeat quickens to the future starting now.
When you feel worried for instance,
I’ll come running right away wanting to hug you tightly,
Wherever you are, No matter where, Fly high!

The one I want to call my lover is you.

I feel like our meeting changed me.
I found the person I want to be.
The thing I longed for.
Was growing inside my heart the whole time
Everyone was jumping a giant jump rope.
But I was too scared to join.
I was hesitant, like a child.
Always waiting for you.
You reached out to me when I gave up.
I loved the warmth of your gentle hand.
I’m overflowing with thank you for you.
Little by little I’m getting closer to my dream.
I’m overflowing with thank you for you.
Thank you.
I’m so happy, so happy, so beyond happy,
That I’m crying sorry.
If I say goodbye to my hesitant feelings.
Instead of being lost for words and hanging my head.
I always, always long to see you.
I can’t let it end inside my heart.
I jumped rope with everyone so many times.
And even smiled a bunch myself.
I want us to be together while playing.
That feeling is precious to me.
When I was lost along the road, you taught me.
Your gentle eyes told me my dream would come true.
This heart-pounding feeling won’t disappear when I say thank you.
I’ll grasp my dream little by little.
This heart-pounding feeling won’t disappear when I say thank you…
Thank you.
It’s so much fun, it’s so much fun, when I tried to hold you.
I cried sorry.
I’m overflowing with thank you for you

Try your hardest, never never never give up

Try your hardest, never never never give up
Na NaNaNa Na that's what I wanna be
It practically takes a genius to be as dense as you
Anyone else would've noticed ages ago
“Huh?”
Pretending it’s a coincidence again today
Should I try ambushing you?
But that’s so lonely
Look over here!
I’m praying, you know
I’m crying, you know (Please)
My love can't, can' bear fruit (can't it?)
Instead of the main plot, it’s a side story (Hey now!)
Fix your habit of going on ahead (I’m over here)
I’m rushing, you know
I’m crying, you know (I've had it with this!)
My love can, can... can, can, can bear fruit?
In short: I like you, so try to like me back (Smooch)

I'm trying so hard to make you see, yet you don't get it at all
I keep feeling on edge lately, I just can't relax like this
“Roger!”
You’re oblivious to the point of simplicity
My passionate feelings are lightyears away from you
That's why I have to try and do my best
I want to become your girlfriend!
I’m hesitant
I want to feel it (I want to know)
I can, can be caught by love (I was caught)
The whole novel is probably a love story (Lovey-dovey)
I tried writing it for the two of us (It’s a happy end, right?)
I’m troubled
I feel it (Geez, you idiot)
I can, can... can, can, can be caught by love!
In other words... Say 'I love you' aloud (Hug!)
(Dododododo do dodo do) Do your best
Lovey-dovey (ey ey ey)
Lovey-dovey (ey ey ey)
Lovey-dovey (ey ey ey)
A happy ending, right?

Here's my small signal, rin-rin-ring a bell
If you can hear, nod and give me your answer, please!
Please let my ability to find mysterious awaken
I want to feel excited every day
But not because of you...you've got it all wrong!
I'm in a strange mood, it feels like all excuses
I end up calling out to you after all
and laugh as always
Just a little (just a little), my heartbeat's (faster than normal)
Why's my heart racing? Why?
I want to get started now, rin-rin-ring a bell
That's weird...but it's not love, sheesh!
Here's my small signal, rin-rin-ring a bell
You pretended to not hear, but I kept on ringing
Whenever I feel cramped, I take a walk
My step suddenly feels so light
You're not here, are you? Yeah, you definitely aren't! 
What if we met by coincidence? How'd I feel?
I don't want you to feel down
But I'm not interested - it's written all over your face
The truth is (the truth is), having expectations hurts!
Can I just dream? Can I?
I wanna make sure, ren-ren-rendezvous
It's so fun...isn't this love?
In my heart, a colorful ren-ren-rendezvous
My reddening cheeks are too honest!
I want to get started now, rin-rin-ring a bell
That's weird...is it completely strange?
Here's my small signal, rin-rin-ring a bell
You pretended to not hear, but I kept on ringing
Give me your answer, please!
The time has come to welcome the moment we’ve always waited for.
Is it okay for me to feeling so much happiness?
This road we walk down, beckoned by the light,
Continues on to the future, brimming with hope.
Anyone can become cute? Yes, I know it’s possible!
Even someone like me… Transform!
So, I’ll give this to you. Cheer up! With our smiles just the way they are,
Let’s sing, let’s sing! I’ll give this to you. Cheer up!
Let’s stop worrying and look to our dreams.
If I’m with all of you, my beloved friends, new things are within my reach.
Let’s be reborn! From here, your world will grow even more.
Come on, I can see tomorrow!
Love wing… love wing…
I’m casting off my hesitation. Let’s straighten our backs and stand tall.
Oh, that’s nice. Now then, let’s just enjoy the wonders here.
The self that I never knew was bathed in light.
Even if it’s just for today, I want to be as brilliant as I can be.
Let’s all become cute! It’s definitely possible.
Just look, even I can… Transform!
Yes, that’s right, every girl will have her day to be a princess.
So happy, so happy, it’s just like magic.
Surprise brings forth the pulse of a dream.
Love is an important thing; it lets you do some wonderful things.
Let’s be reborn. Let’s go look for the next stage.
Now, what kind of ‘me’ shall I be tomorrow?
Love bell love bell

Love wing love bell
I sigh, alone on the beach
As I continue to recall your smile
My sighs linger in the air
Even after all this time, my heart still hurts
When summer ended, my love ended as well (Farewell)
Every day with you was so miraculously fun
When did the autumn breeze begin to blow?
If only I could see you one more time (I know I can't)
I wish my love could reach you
If only I could see you one more time...
I don't want to forget that blue coral reef
I can't return to those exciting days
During that season, all of the time spent awake was precious
We embraced that excitement
As we walked together, on and on
When summer ended, our love disappeared as well Farewell
I believed that our happiness would continue on forever
So why did you leave me behind?
Those memories are already far, far away A beautiful dream
Even though my love hasn't changed
Those memories are already far, far away...
Love is a mirage that will disappear eventually
I won't forget the heat from the white sand, or the color of your tanned skin
They'll become precious memories They will, they will
But even so, these tears will never dry up
If only I could see you one more time I know I can't
I wish my love could reach you
If only I could see you one more time...
I don't want to forget that blue coral reef
Alone on the beach... sighing to myself...
Alone on the beach... sighing to myself...
In your eyes burns a blue flame; Putting on a strong front, you the LONELIEST BABY
So, comin' comin' back!
Just staying sulky there doesn't work, you know?
Look over here... Please!
Somehow painful one day, shaking with loneliness one day
Oh yeah, oh yeah! Teach me my boy
Aiming for the waiting night sky
Call me, call me!! The signal you're skipping is "L.O.V.E"
Because I want to hug you with these feelings of love
I'm gazing at only you right here
Always I love you I love you (I want to tell you) I love you I love you
No matter when　Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!)　Without losing
I'm praying　Ah...!(Let's fight!)
I love you I love you (Love you love you) I love you I love you
Don't forget during the times when you're tired, just a little bit
Recall and think about me　Baby!
The oath your seriousness conceived, don't tell it to anyone
So, goin' goin' now!
If you're too quiet there'll be misunderstandings, you know?
Say something... Please!
Crying in the rain one day, getting drenched and sad one day
Oh yeah, oh yeah! I want to meet you my boy
I've been waiting, my heart is calling out
Call me, call me!! The signal right now is "L.O.V.E"
Once you're in love, everything can be forgiven
Really... Because I am someone that belongs only to you
Always I love you I love you Unchanging I love you I love you
Sometimes　Hi!Hi! Hi!Hi!　Also weak
What's dear to me　Ah...!I know!
I love you I love you I love you I love you
Because you're dear to me, when you want to take a break, I want to protect you gently
I wanna hold you, Baby!
Hi! Hi! Why, I wonder?
Even when you're strong and even when you're weak
Hi! Hi! I love you!
I love all of it, the lonely my boy
Your oath, your heart; you are you are, lonely boy
The passionate you, where is it you're aiming for?
Always I love you I love you (Unchanging) I love you I love you
Sometimes　Hi!(Hi!) Hi!(Hi!)　Also weak
What's dear to me　Ah...!(I know!)
Always I love you I love you (I want to tell you) I love you I love you
No matter when　Hi!Hi! Hi!Hi!　Without losing
I'm praying　Ah...!Let's fight!
I love you I love you I love you I love you
Don't forget during the times when you're tired, just a little bit
Recall and think about me　Baby!
Oh baby I love you, oh baby I love you!
You are you are, Lonely boy
Oh baby I love you, oh baby I love you!
Oh baby I love you!!
No, don’t stop, I’m getting hot from you
“I’m still dreaming an innocent dream”
When I whisper that into your ear
I close my eyes and sigh, It’s your fault
I dissolve into the sea bathing in the moonlight
Before diving into love
I won’t say anything…It’s-A-Se-cret
If I speak I’ll turn into foam, I’m a mermaid
The waves brought me here
Summer love is a painful festa which won’t come twice
I dance with the waves so
Let the magic of sound ring out loudly for this year’s festa
Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I kind of know, I’ll know when I turn around
I’m getting hot from you
“Why aren’t you coming here? Are you aware?”
I’ll try teasing you a bit
Those painful excuses are so like you
The tension fills my heart with even more excitement
Symbols are written in the sand with bare feet
If you flip it around it reads I love you
What will you do when you notice? Will you be looking at me?
Next embrace me tightly
I’ll get away nimbly, Because now is the beginning of love
I want to be held tightly after that
You’re so gentle, What I want to know is you acting aggressively
Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I’ll pout over and over, I’ll pout even if we cuddle up
Spoil me
The waves brought me here
Summer love is a painful festa which won’t come twice
I dance with the waves so
Let the magic of sound ring out loudly for this year’s festa
Are you alarmed? Are you nervous?
I kind of know, I’ll know when I turn around
Let it ring out, Let the summer love ring out
No, don’t stop, I’m getting hot from you
The rhythm gradually changes into a sweet Fruits dance
In a hurry
Looking back at myself
I do not look back at what I have caught
I want to be chased
But I won't say it; But I can't say it 
So, right?
I'll come around, come around, come around
Let's dance and come around, come around
I want fresh experiences no matter what they may be
What we need is probably a feverish love
You don't know? Who is going to come?
Waiting like fruits to be harvested
From a hard, yellow colour → it grows pink
I'm trembling shaking
If you reach it now... Yes!
The rhythm gradually changes into a sweet Fruits dance
In a hurry
Looking back at myself
I do not look back at what I have caught
I want to be chased
But I won't say it; But I can't say it 
So, right?
I'll come around, come around, come around
Let's dance and come around, come around
I don't want to forget every new day
I hope if you can keep this secret kiss
Is it too early? Is it good even if only a little?
Fruits are thorny so be careful
Turning blue with a sweet scent → Transformed and ready to be eaten
I try to touch it gently
You... Please do not get lost again!
The passionate, burning hot summer gives out a tingling sensation
It does not stop
Hey, I am about to burst in this season
Surprisingly turning bullish
I want to be hugged
But you know, I will blush; But you know, it is embarrassing.
I, right?
It is intense and come around, come around, come around
I lose and come around, come around
By the time a white ship comes gliding through the beach
So that the distance between us may shrink
A little more... a little more... I try to close my eyelids
The passionate, burning hot summer gives out a tingling sensation
It does not stop
Hey, I am about to burst in this season
Surprisingly turning bullish
I want to be hugged
But you know, I will blush; But you know, it is embarrassing.
I, right?
It is intense and come around, come around, come around
I lose and come around, come around
This passionate, burning heat gives out a tingling sensation
The rhythm gradually changes into a Fruits dance
Now, where shall our smiles take us?
Think of where you want to go
Hurry, let's go!
Having fun could be the key to using your heart
Brush away all of the things you don't like
Yes, let's go!
Look up to the sky, and your tears will seem to fade away
Come on, come on, come on, here's a hint!
We've discovered treasures right here and now
Lots of them; they're everyone's smiles
The treasures we've discovered
Here are our overwhelming dreams show me more and more of them!
Courage is important, so let's hurry and go!
Wish for it with all your might
Right now, let's go!
Let's use our frustration too; we'll turn it into something positive
When things get unbearable, it's okay to be a bit selfish
It's fine, so let's go!
Our love grants an unbeatable power
Grab it, grab it, grab it, reach for it!
No one knows about these treasures yet
They're all searching for them, yes, everyone's trying hard
These undiscovered treasures
Are so close, yet so far they'll never stop shining
We've discovered treasures right here and now
Lots of them; they're everyone's smiles
The treasures we've discovered
Here are our overwhelming dreams show me more and more of them!
I know happy holiday, happy holiday
Get together at the usual place

We talk about whatever we want today, Happy time
The rumored chocolate Delicious!
I tried lining them up Melting
Love is bittersweet Together
So, So, It’s sweet and bitter
Now is everything
Yet I easily worried about the past
It’s weird, Yeah, It’s not like me so it’s weird
I wanted you to listen for a minute to the seeds of my worries
It’s laughable when put into words
I wonder if I can feed them to the birds as snacks
I know happy holiday, happy holiday
It’ll be fun so get together
I say happy holiday, happy holiday
With everyone’s voices, shiny day
I know happy holiday, happy holiday
My heart’s bursting open honestly
I say happy holiday, happy holiday

Rainbow-colored macaroon (Gimme!)
Mouthful of magic (Gonna disappear)
Easily-broken love (An adventure)
But you know, But you know, I want more
This is now
Dispel the gloom of ordinary days
What? I chewed on it, Is it really like us?
With a superb smile of course I can’t lose
The energy sleeping at the bottom of my body
Unleashed my enthusiastic style
We are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
It’s refreshing moving so cheerfully
You are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
It’s coming to everybody, sunny day
We are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
Let’s bust out into chitchat with honest expressions
You are dancing everyday, dancing everyday
I love you so it’s great, Dancing girls
I know happy holiday, happy holiday
It’ll be fun so get together
I say happy holiday, happy holiday
With everyone’s voices, shiny day

Choco-Choco-Chocolate Delicious!
Maca-maca-macaron Isn't it delicious?
Love’s melting.
Wanna give it a shot?
So, So, It’s sweet and bitter.
Where is this place?
Wait, even if you don't say it, I already know
It's a warm mirage I saw in my dreams
Who are you?
I won't ask because I already know
This is an encounter called forth by our wishes
The first star that shines brighter the further it gets
I always wanted to try a romance like that
My heart's brakes are no longer needed
We were born just to meet and become a pair
Ah! I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that prefers "More"
I won't let my wings be mere decorations
Ah! Though I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that likes "More"
I've realized what's important isn't tomorrow
But rather the present instead
My pounding heartbeat can't be stopped
We've always believed in it and understood,
that our encounter was for us to collide with each other
The colder it gets the hotter the flames of my steps
That's right, I'll bet everything for the sake of love
Come, let yourself be attracted, just enough to get hurt a bit
This sparkling tear, is it from joy or from sympathy?
Ah! This passion will last only for this night, and never again
We'll have to dance until this passion burns out
Ah! This passion will last only for this night, and never again
"If you catch me, keep holding on to me tightly," I whispered
This precious dream has yet to end
I knew that time couldn't be stopped
So I wanted to meet you much earlier
I'll let the words I want to convey dissolve into this sound, and Call Angel!
Ah! I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that prefers "More"
I won't let my wings be mere decorations
Ah! Though I don't want "Maybe"
I'm an Angel that likes "More"
I've realized what's important isn't tomorrow
But rather the present instead
My pounding heartbeat can't be stopped
